Project Overview:
This project involves scraping data from a bookstore website, including the title, price, and ranking of books. It also downloads the images of the books and saves them using the book's name, which is specified in the src attribute of the <img> tag in the HTML content.
Libraries used:
os
requests
BeautifulSoup (bs4)

All images are saved in a folder called "images," which is created programmatically within the projectâ€™s folder.
